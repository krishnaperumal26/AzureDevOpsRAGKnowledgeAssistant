# Azure DevOps RAG Knowledge Tool

This is a knowledge management and guidance tool for Scrum teams, built with FastAPI and a modern HTML/CSS/JS frontend. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with OpenAI and integrates with Azure DevOps to provide context-aware answers during refinement sessions.

## Features
- **OpenAI & Azure DevOps Integration:** Enter your OpenAI API key and Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (PAT) in the UI.
- **Custom Document Upload:** Upload multiple requirement documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) for use as RAG context.
- **Azure DevOps Wiki & PBIs:** Fetches and uses Wiki pages, Product Backlog Items, and Features from your Azure DevOps project.
- **Vector Database:** All content (documents + Azure DevOps) is embedded and stored in a vector DB (FAISS) for fast retrieval.
- **Interactive Chat:** Ask questions and get context-aware answers from the bot, using all available knowledge sources.
- **Modern, Colorful UI:** User-friendly, interactive, and visually appealing interface.
